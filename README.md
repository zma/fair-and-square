Fair and square numbers
=======================

A fair and square number is a number that is a palindrome and a square of another palindrome (from [Google code jam Qualification Round 2013](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/2270488/dashboard#s=p2)).

This program in OCaml generate the fair and square numbers that have less than 100 digits.

A list of generated fair and square numbers is already in [fair-and-square.txt](https://raw.github.com/zma/fair-and-square/master/fair-and-sqaure.txt).

To compile the code (you need `ocamlopt`):

  make

To generate the list:

  ./fairsquare
